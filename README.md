Arduino Code for a 4-wheel robot

This code is a good basis for learning about Arduino, or jump-starting your own project.

It has classes for motor controllers and ultrasonic sensors, and uses a library for the IR sensor.

This code is subject to frequent changes, and will hopefully have a better AutoPilot mode working soon.
